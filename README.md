TorrentRSSDownloader

This is used to download torrents from an rss feed, verify against plex and then organize the media when the torrent completes.

My setup is as follows:

deluge setup to monitor F:\Incoming\Monitor and move completed to Z:\Completed
plex is installed locally and listening on localhost
this will scan plex and add new shows as needed

This application currently does not have any ui so just open the database file you setup/add what you need.  It may take some fucking with but it does work
